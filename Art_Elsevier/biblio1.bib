	abstract = {A discrete fracture model for the flow of compressible, multicomponent fluids in homogeneous, heterogeneous, and fractured media is presented in single phase. In the numerical model we combine the mixed finite element (MFE) and the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods. We use the cross-flow equilibrium concept to approximate the fractured matrix mass transfer. The discrete fracture model is numerically superior to the single-porosity model and overcomes limitations of the dual-porosity models including the use of a shape factor. The MFE method provides a direct and accurate approximation for the velocity field, which is crucial for the convective terms in the flow equations. The DG method associated with a slope limiter is used to approximate the species balance equations. This method can capture the sharp moving fronts. The calculation of the fracture-fracture flux across three and higher intersecting fracture branches is a challenge. In this work, we provide an accurate approximation of these fluxes by using the MFE formulation. Numerical examples in unfractured and fractured media illustrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed numerical model.},

	abstract = "Abstract A general state-based peridynamic formulation is presented for convective single-phase flow of a liquid of small and constant compressibility in heterogeneous porous media. In addition to local fluid transport, possible anomalous diffusion due to non-local fluid transport is considered and simulated. The governing integral equations of the peridynamic formulation are computationally easier to solve in domains with discontinuities than the traditional conservation models containing spatial derivatives. A bond-based peridynamic formulation is also developed and demonstrated to be a special case of the state-based formulation. The non-local model does not assume continuity in the field variables, satisfies mass conservation over an arbitrary bounded body and approaches the corresponding local model as the non-local region goes to zero. The exact solution of the local model closely matches the non-local model for a classical two-dimensional flow problem with fluid sources and sinks and for both Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions. The model is shown to capture arbitrary flow discontinuities/heterogeneities without any fundamental changes to the model and with small incremental computational costs."

	abstract = "Abstract Drying is one of the most energy intensive industrial processes with applications in a wide variety of industries including the timber industry, the food industry, and the construction industry. In order to understand the physics of drying at a fundamental level it is necessary to analyze the motion of liquid and gas through a capillary porous medium. The governing transport equations are comprised of a set of tightly coupled, highly nonlinear partial differential equations for the dynamic system variables of moisture content, temperature, and internal gaseous pressure. Due to the complexity of this system of equations there is usually little alternative but to employ a numerical solution technique. In this work an innovative scheme known as the unstructured mesh cell-centered control volume method will be analyzed and subsequently applied to high temperature drying of softwood. The method will be tested for a wide range of meshes each having differently shaped polygonal control volumes or cells. This new method will lay the foundation for studying problems that concern heat and mass transfer in porous media defined on complex geometries, or more importantly, for drying problems that include a stress analysis implemented on a dynamically distorting mesh. The work consists of two parts: Part I is devoted to the study of isotropic porous materials using a two-node and a four-node formulation for the discretization of the equations on an unstructured mesh; in Part II the numerical discretization associated with the complex problem of an anisotropic porous material is presented."

	abstract = "Abstract A general 2-D finite element multi-component reactive transport code, TRANQUI, was developed, using a sequential iteration approach (SIA). It is well suited to deal with complex real-world thermo-hydro-geochemical problems for single-phase variably water saturated porous media flow systems. The model considers a wide range of hydrological and thermodynamic as well as chemical processes such as aqueous complexation, acid-base, redox, mineral dissolution/precipitation, gas dissolution/ex-solution, ion exchange and adsorption via surface complexation. Under unsaturated conditions only water flow is considered, although gas pressures are allowed to vary in space in a depth-dependent manner specified by the user. In addition to the fully iterative sequential approach (SIA), a sequential non-iterative approach (SNIA), in which transport and chemistry are de-coupled, was implemented and tested. The accuracy and numerical performance of SIA and SNIA have been compared using several test cases. The accuracy of SNIA depends on space and time discretization as well as on the nature of the chemical reactions. The capability of the code to model a real case study in the field is illustrated by its application to the modeling of the hydrochemical evolution of the Llobregat Delta aquitard in northeastern Spain over the last 3500 years during when fresh-water flow from a lower aquifer displaced the native saline aquitard waters. Manzano and Custodio carried out a reactive transport model of this case study by using the PHREEQM code and considering water flow, aqueous complexation, cation exchange and calcite dissolution. Their results compare favorably well with measured porewater chemical data, except for some of the cations. Our code is not only able to reproduce the results of previous numerical models, but leads to computed concentrations which are closer to measured data mainly because our model takes into consideration redox processes in addition to the processes mentioned above. A number of sensitivity runs were performed with TRANQUI in order to analyze the effect of errors and uncertainties on cation selectivities."

In view of mesh adaptivity, we exhibit residual type error indicators and prove estimates which allow to compare them with the error in a very accurate way.",

	abstract = {The theoretical basis for the integrated finite difference method (IFDM) is presented to describe a powerful numerical technique for solving problems of groundwater flow in porous media. The method combines the advantages of an integral formulation with the simplicity of finite difference gradients and is very convenient for handling multidimensional heterogeneous systems composed of isotropic materials. Three illustrative problems are solved to demonstrate that two- and three-dimensional problems are handled with equal ease. Comparison of IFDM with the well-known finite element method (FEM) indicates that both are conceptually similar and differ mainly in the procedure adopted for measuring spatial gradients. The IFDM includes a simple criterion for local stability and an efficient explicit-implicit iterative scheme for marching in the time domain. If such a scheme can be incorporated in a new version of FEM, it should be possible to develop an improved numerical technique that combines the inherent advantages of both methods.},

Both multiscale finite element method and conventional finite element method are applied to five 2-D and two 3-D groundwater flow problems, including a 2-D steady flow problem with continuous coefficients, a 2-D steady flow with gradual change in coefficients, a 2-D transient flow with gradual change in coefficients, a 2-D steady flow problem with an abrupt change in coefficients, a 2-D transient flow problem with an abrupt change in coefficients, and a 3-D steady and a 3-D transient flow problem with gradual change in coefficients in the horizontal direction and with abrupt change in the vertical direction, respectively. The applications demonstrate the main advantages of the multiscale finite element method, i.e., significantly reducing computational efforts and improving the accuracy of the solutions.},

A strong feature of the methods is the ability to handle media inhomogeneities in combination with full-tensor anisotropy and/or non-orthogonality of the grid. Further properties of the methods will be discussed and examples of their use will be presented."

	abstract = {Based on the theory of double-porosity, a novel mathematical model for multiphase fluid flow in a deforming fractured reservoir is developed. The present formulation, consisting of both the equilibrium and continuity equations, accounts for the significant influence of coupling between fluid flow and solid deformation, usually ignored in the reservoir simulation literature. A Galerkin-based finite element method is applied to discretize the governing equations both in the space and time domain. Throughout the derived set of equations the solid displacements as well as the fluid pressure values are considered as the primary unknowns and may be used to determine other reservoir parameters such as stresses, saturations, etc. The final set of equations represents a highly non-linear system as the elements of the coefficient matrices are updated during each iteration in terms of the independent variables. The model is employed to solve a field scale example where the results are compared to those of ten other uncoupled models. The results illustrate a significantly different behaviour for the case of a reservoir where the impact of coupling is also considered. © 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {A mathematical model is presented for numerical simulation of solute transport in naturally fractured porous media. The model is based on the dual-porosity conceptual approach and is capable of simulating interactions between porous rock matrix and fractures. Unlike earlier dual-porosity transport models, which rely on parallel fracture assumptions, the present model is a unified model that is also able to represent blocky fractured systems (i.e., systems with suborthogonal fractures) by using a spherical idealization of matrix blocks. Two governing, partial differential equations are written for solute transport in the fractures and diffusion in the porous matrix blocks. These equations are coupled by mass flux terms (leakages). An efficient numerical scheme is presented for approximating the governing transport equations. The scheme effectively combines a two-dimensional, upstream-weighted, finite-element approximation for transport in the fractures with a one-dimensional Galerkin approximation for diffusion within the individual matrix blocks. Coupling of the two approximations is performed implicitly. The systems of algebraic equations resulting from both finite-element approximations are solved by using sequential solution algorithms designed especially for this type of problem. Stability and accuracy of the numerical scheme are checked by applying the model to a number of test problems and comparing results with available analytical solutions. In all cases the numerical scheme is found to be highly stable and capable of producing reliable results with the use of relatively coarse spatial and temporal discretizations. Finally, the utility of the model is demonstrated by applying it to a hypothetical, yet realistic, problem.},

	abstract = "Abstract We introduce a multidimensional peridynamic formulation for transient heat-transfer. The model does not contain spatial derivatives and uses instead an integral over a region around a material point. By construction, the formulation converges to the classical heat transfer equations in the limit of the horizon (the nonlocal region around a point) going to zero. The new model, however, is suitable for modeling, for example, heat flow in bodies with evolving discontinuities such as growing insulated cracks. We introduce the peridynamic heat flux which exists even at sharp corners or when the isotherms are not smooth surfaces. The peridynamic heat flux coincides with the classical one in simple cases and, in general, it converges to it in the limit of the peridynamic horizon going to zero. We solve test problems and compare results with analytical solutions of the classical model or with other numerical solutions. Convergence to the classical solutions is seen in the limit of the horizon going to zero. We then solve the problem of transient heat flow in a plate in which insulated cracks grow and intersect thus changing the heat flow patterns. We also model heat transfer in a fiber-reinforced composite and observe transient but steep thermal gradients at the interfaces between the highly conductive fibers and the low conductivity matrix. Such thermal gradients can lead to delamination cracks in composites from thermal fatigue. The formulation may be used to, for example, evaluate effective thermal conductivities in bodies with an evolving distribution of insulating or permeable, possibly intersecting, cracks of arbitrary shapes."

We review residual based stabilized mixed methods applied to Darcy flow in homogeneous porous media and extend them to heterogeneous media with an interface of discontinuity. For smooth interfaces, the proposed formulations preserve the continuity of the flux and exactly imposes the constraint between the tangent components of Darcy velocity on the interface. Convergence studies for a heterogeneous and anisotropic porous medium confirm the same rates of convergence predicted for homogeneous problem with smooth solutions."
